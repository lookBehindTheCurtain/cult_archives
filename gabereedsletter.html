			<span class="c10 c1">Living in The Book of Acts</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage&mdash;with great patience and careful instruction. For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.&rdquo;<br></span>
			<span class="c10 c1">2 Timothy 4:1-5</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">I wasn&rsquo;t going to write anything until later on down the road. On our way out, my wife and I really just wanted to focus on moving forward with God and with our lives. But the day we left, our email was flooded with people who said they were feeling like they wanted to leave as well. Even still, I didn&rsquo;t want to persuade anyone one way or another. But then I remembered the Scripture above. This was the Scripture that my father in the faith read to me when he appointed me as an Evangelist at the 2014 Global Leadership Conference.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">In front of 2,000 witnesses, I made a declaration to uphold this Scripture&mdash;to preach the word, to correct, rebuke, and encourage. Because the day will come, and I believe has come, when men will not put up with sound doctrine but instead gather around a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. And then I remembered that by that oath, I am obligated to speak up, speak out, and speak against any doctrine that is not sound. I do not claim to be a Bible scholar, but that word in the Greek is
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">hygiano</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">, which means &ldquo;to be sound, to be well, to be in good health.&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">If you want to save yourself time reading through this rather long document, then know that essentially we left the International Christian Churches/SoldOut Discipling Movement because we found the doctrine to not be sound or healthy for true Christians. You can be saved there, but I believe eventually you have to leave because the foundation of the movement is broken. We went all the way back to when we first studied the First Principles and decided to be noble Bereans (Acts 17:10-12) and check up on what our religious leaders have told us to see if what they were saying was true. We found more deviations from the Scriptures than we expected, and so we made the decision that God was calling us to come out of the ICC.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">Who This Is Addressed To</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">Before we get into the what, when, why, and how, I want to first start by defining who this is addressed to.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">Kip McKean</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Brother, the reality is that if it was not for your faith, vision, and drive to see the world, many of us would not have come to know Christ the way we have. For that, we say thank you. With that being said, I believe there are some serious flaws in your teaching that need your careful consideration immediately. I understand you have been doing this for nearly 40 years now, so this may come across as a personal attack. Please know this is not a personal attack on you or what you have built. At this point in my life, I&rsquo;m no longer a part of your organization, so how you respond will not directly impact the decisions of my life. This is not intended to be a rebuke but an exhortation (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">1 Timothy 5:1</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">The International Christian Churches&rsquo; World Sector Leaders and Central Leadership Council</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">I understand that for many of you, our brother Kip helped you in a moment when the prior movement had crashed, and many of you were hurting and confused about what was happening. He has helped you renew your faith, marriages, vision, and love for God. He was able to answer and explain so many questions you had at a time when others had no answers for you. All I ask is that you do not allow sentiment to cloud your judgment as you read this document. I am not trying to destroy what you are building, however, I believe you guys have a responsibility to brother Kip and to the people underneath your care. If our brother Kip starts to go astray in doctrine and theology, you have a responsibility to pull him back into sound doctrine because he is the leader of your movement. You also have a responsibility to the people underneath your care, to ensure they are being properly instructed in the word of God (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">1 Peter 5:2-4</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). Again, this is not a rebuke but rather an exhortation.</span>

			<span class="c1">We are not free from the guilt of our leaders if we comply with their decisions. Many of you are aware of the things that I am going to bring up. We&rsquo;ve talked about them when our World Sector Leaders were not around. As you will see in this document, I believe there are only so many &ldquo;Amens&rdquo; you can give before you&rsquo;re just being a people pleaser. You all took an oath of the same Scripture we did (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Timothy 4:1-5</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). You guys learned the same First Principles we did. I&rsquo;m not saying you need to revolt, but you do need to do whatever is necessary to fulfill your oath to this Scripture.</span>

		<p class="c0">

			<li class="c0 c6 li-bullet-0">
				<span class="c1 c11">Use this document as a platform to fight and rebel</span>

				<span class="c1 c11">Dismiss this document without consideration</span>
				<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;of whether some, most, or all of the points I bring up could be valid. Sadly, in my experience, this is what I&rsquo;ve seen in our leadership. Instead of considering and addressing the Scriptures presented, they have made up their minds that they are right and proceed to dismiss the speaker without addressing the issues being raised. They may say things like, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s hurt,&rdquo; &ldquo;bitter,&rdquo; &ldquo;out there,&rdquo; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s talking about,&rdquo; &ldquo;not a disciple,&rdquo; &ldquo;divisive,&rdquo; &ldquo;contemptuous,&rdquo; &ldquo;Satan has got to him,&rdquo; or &ldquo;he deserted us.&rdquo; These comments do not address the concerns I will bring up. This is simply an old ministry technique used to discredit the speaker rather than address the speech. It will often end in marking or disfellowshipment because it&rsquo;s deemed &ldquo;hurtful to the flock.&rdquo; You can respond that way if you want, but that approach leads nowhere&mdash;except maybe to one less friend on Facebook.</span>

		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">The Mature Disciple</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The mature disciple will actually give consideration to the thoughts and Scriptures I present here. Even if they do not change their current beliefs about the topics I discuss, they will nonetheless learn what they can about their own personal walk and the structure and policies of the movement. They will seek to improve what needs improvement, reform the areas that need reformation, and continue building up the kingdom. Or, perhaps, what is said here will resonate with them, and after personal prayer and Bible study, they may find the courage to make similar decisions as my wife and I have.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Why Did We Leave?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Anyone and everyone in the ICC would agree that, from time to time, decisions are made that just don&rsquo;t sit well with you. A pledge drive, an extra push for Special Missions, a young leader in your church being sent somewhere, or being asked/told to do something you don&rsquo;t really want to do. I&rsquo;m sure we could come up with a long list of things. Most of the time, we say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; and get behind whatever is being done, chalking it up to &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just how things are in the kingdom,&rdquo; &ldquo;this is the need of the hour,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the movement is moving,&rdquo; or whatever expression gets you through it. After seven and a half years of saying &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; I finally decided to investigate and search the Scriptures as to why we do what we do. I felt obligated to do so because of the oath I made as an Evangelist, to ensure that the doctrine is sound.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Also, I noticed things happening differently than when I first got baptized. Things were changing, and something inside told me it wasn&rsquo;t for the better. The reality is that I came to the conviction to leave the ICC because I studied the doctrine of the ICC and found it not to be sound doctrine. I did not consult anyone from the ICOC, nor did I talk to someone who was marked or disfellowshipped until after I made the decision to leave. I read our official church documents:
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">First Principles Bible Study Series, Revolution Through Restoration I, II, III, The Biblical Differences Between The ICOC and the ICC, A Concern For All The Churches,</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">After reading our official documents, I came to the conclusion that the reason why we feel like something is off from time to time is because something
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">is</span>
			<span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;off&mdash;it&rsquo;s the foundation on which the movement is built. Today in the ICC, there are at least three foundational issues (I believe there are many more, but these were enough for me to make the decision to leave):</span>

		<p class="c4">
			<span class="c5 c1">Let me start by saying that I absolutely agree with 3 of the 5 Core Convictions. One of them is an opinion and a nice goal so I agree with that one too and one is just down right heretical. However, what I firmly disagree with is how we implement all five of these convictions.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">A Bible Church v. New Testament Church</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Taken from your writing in the article
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;The Biblical Differences Between the International Church of Christ and the International Christian Churches&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">, Kip wrote:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;The Mainline Church of Christ is an off-shoot of the Restoration Movement begun in the United States in the early 1800&rsquo;s by Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, and Barton Stone, to name a few. Their plea was to &ldquo;restore the New Testament Church.&rdquo; Therefore, they believed that though the Old Testament was divinely inspired and historically accurate, only the New Testament would be their sole rule of faith and practice in deciding matters of doctrine, including ecclesiastical structure. This is now the conviction of the most influential leaders in the ICOC.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">However, we in the ICC believe like Paul, who wrote in late 66 AD &ndash; some 35 years after the beginning of the church,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;(</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Timothy 3:16</span>
			<span class="c1">) Technically speaking, the word &ldquo;Scripture&rdquo; in this passage refers only to the Old Testament. Now, through the inspiration of the Spirit, we believe that it applies as well to the New Testament. Though we believe &ldquo;the Law&rdquo; is no longer binding (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Colossians 2:13-14</span>
			<span class="c1">), the Scriptural concepts in the Old Testament, such as &ldquo;calling out the remnant,&rdquo; &ldquo;dating and marrying only disciples,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a central leader and leadership for God&rsquo;s movement&rdquo; are in the New Testament. Yet, the Old Testament is much richer in its depth on these vital issues. Also, the &ldquo;Jethro Principle&rdquo; of leadership in
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Exodus 18</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;allows us to lead and take care of thousands of God&rsquo;s precious people. Therefore, we believe we are commanded by God to build congregations based on both the Old and New Testaments &ndash; a &ldquo;Bible Church,&rdquo; not simply a &ldquo;New Testament Church.&rdquo;</span>

			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">As I read through this again and again, initially in an effort to defend our cause, I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, what did Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, and Barton Stone mean when their plea was to &ldquo;restore the New Testament Church&rdquo;? Are they not just trying to get back to the church of the Bible? Kip often preaches regarding the evangelization of nations in this generation,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;that if they did it in the first century, we can do it in the 21st century!&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;Is that not trying to restore the New Testament church?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Even in Kip&rsquo;s own
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Revolution Through Restoration</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;(which every ICCM student is required to read), the article says:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;During my years at Charleston and Memphis, I devoted myself to studying the Old Testament. At this major turning point in my life, I came to a deep conviction that, unlike the traditional Church of Christ which claimed only to be a
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&lsquo;New Testament church,&rsquo;</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;a better understanding of God&#39;s eternal plan would cause us to be a

			<span class="c7 c1 c3">Revolution Through Restoration I</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;The Lord allowed me to begin the restoration of the New Testament church from a small group of 30 would-be disciples in the Gempels&#39; living room in June of 1979 in Boston.&rdquo;<br>&mdash;</span>

		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">So here we have three articles written by the same person in three different time periods. In the first (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Revolution Through Restoration I</span>
			<span class="c1">), it is stated that it is better to be a Bible church rather than a New Testament church. In the second (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Revolution Through Restoration II</span>
			<span class="c1">), the focus seems to be the restoration of the New Testament church. And in the third (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Biblical Differences Between the ICOC and ICC</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">), the ICOC is condemned for being just a New Testament church. It seemed to me that whichever approach was convenient to our brother Kip at the time was considered the right way.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">In the article on the
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Biblical Differences Between the ICOC and ICC,</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;it was said that the ICOC&rsquo;s fault was that they used only the New Testament for &ldquo;deciding matters of doctrine including ecclesiastical structure.&rdquo; Then
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Timothy 3:16-17</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;was quoted. However,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Timothy 3:16-17</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;has nothing to do with deciding matters of doctrine as it pertains to ecclesiastical structure; it concerns teaching, correcting, rebuking, and training, primarily through preaching to prevent people from turning to false doctrine (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Timothy 4:1-3</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). Why aren&rsquo;t we letting the Bible interpret the Bible instead of using it to support our views?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">How can we say that we are no longer bound by the Law but then threaten church discipline on anyone who doesn&rsquo;t give a tithe? Tithing is an Old Testament commandment. How can we say we aren&rsquo;t bound by the Law yet use Scriptures like
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Deuteronomy 17:12-13</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;to disfellowship anyone who shows contempt? It seems to me that we are binding people to the Law. The reason we rely so heavily on the Old Testament is because, without it, we cannot implement the false doctrine that there must be a centralized leadership with a central leader inside of Christianity.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">I have no problem with using the Old Testament for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training of men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s characters, as
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Timothy 3:16-17</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;instructs us, but using the Old Testament to establish ecclesiastical structure is not healthy doctrine. Yes, I believe in being a Bible church, but not in the way the ICC interprets a Bible church.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">In the Movement, this &ldquo;Core Conviction&rdquo; is implemented in such a way that all it does is bind God&rsquo;s people to man-made traditions of discipleship partners (taken from
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Exodus 18</span>
			<span class="c1">), a central leader (taken from
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Numbers 27:15-17</span>
			<span class="c1">), and financial sacrifice (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Malachi 3:6-12</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). I do not think that discipleship partners, a central leader, and giving a weekly contribution are wrong. But when we don&rsquo;t allow people the freedom to decide for themselves the degree to which they will implement these man-made traditions in their own lives, I believe we take liberties the Scriptures do not give us.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">When we tell God&rsquo;s people who is going to disciple them, that they must have a discipler because that is how we practice discipleship in our fellowship, that they must submit to the Central Leadership, and that they are required to give a contribution&mdash;all of these expectations placed upon them before they can be baptized in our fellowship&mdash;we are no better than the Pharisees.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people&rsquo;s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;(</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Matthew 23:13-14</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">)</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">There is no way, before God, that we can tell people they must believe in a Bible Church as we interpret it before they can be baptized in our fellowship and think we are doing a service to the lost or to God.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;Along with this, I came to differ with the Churches of Christ whose creed is &#39;to speak where the Bible speaks and be silent where the Bible is silent.&#39; This creed dictated that one must have specific authorization by command, example, or necessary inference from the Bible to do anything. It developed a legalistic, Pharisaic mindset that sowed the seed for much dissension and division, producing the factions of the Churches of Christ.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">For example, the whole mandate to only &#39;call Bible things by Bible names&#39; is contradictory because the word &#39;Bible&#39; is not even in the Bible! From the Scriptures, I came to believe the opposite. I believe that we should be silent where the Bible speaks and speak where the Bible is silent. In other words, a Christian should simply obey where the Bible speaks and only speak (have opinions) where the Bible is silent.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">In building a life, a church, or a &#39;system&#39; for a movement, we are &#39;free&#39; to do anything the Scriptures do not specifically, by command, by example, or by necessary inference prohibit (</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">; Kip and those Kip appoints hold all the authority to speak where the Bible is silent. Whenever Kip or Kip&rsquo;s personally appointed leaders form an opinion on something, the rest of us are bound to it.</span>

			<span class="c1">For instance, it was decided that we would have a three-times Missions contribution in February. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Bible is silent on how, when, and how much we are to collect for planting churches, yet someone spoke where the Bible was silent, and now we are all bound to it. Last year, someone decided how much the Global Leadership Conference would cost. No problem. But then every evangelist was hounded with weekly, sometimes daily, emails asking for an update on how many people were registered so that we would break even in the budget.

			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;Though the ICOC is mixed in these practices, at the 2002 Long Beach Unity Meeting, there was a call to eliminate World Sector Leaders, Lead Evangelists, and Women&rsquo;s Ministry Leaders because these &#39;titles&#39; could not be found in the New Testament. Thus they were deemed &#39;unbiblical.&#39;&rdquo;</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">I did some research to see what the ICOC actually believes, and I found this written by Mike Taliaferro in 2014 in response to an article written by Raul Moreno (which appears to have been taken down from our archives&hellip;).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;Another statement that caught our attention was, &#39;The mainline Churches of Christ and the ICOC of today in general believe that the principles and methodologies that can be applied to the church are found only in the New Testament. They embrace the teachings of the American restoration movement of the 1800&rsquo;s. Thomas Campbell, one of the early restoration movement leaders, coined the phrase, &quot;Speak where the Bible speaks and be silent where the Bible is silent.&quot; In other words, if there was not an explicit command or pattern in the New Testament, then any other practice would be viewed as &quot;unscriptural.&quot; For example, it became a sin in the eyes of the mainline Church of Christ to use musical instruments in the worship service, because it does not occur in the churches in the New Testament, except in heaven in Revelation.&#39;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">This statement is a complete misrepresentation of the ICOC. First of all, church buildings, pews, songbooks, Bible Talks, discipleship partners, Bring Your Neighbor Day, sound amplification, communion trays, and printed invitations are not found in the pages of the New Testament. We have no problem with them. They are obviously expedient and useful in carrying out the commands found in the Bible. I know of no evangelist or elder in the ICOC who believes that any practice not mentioned in the Bible is &ldquo;unscriptural.&rdquo; And you must know, Raul, that most of our congregations use musical instruments in their worship services. Why do you accuse us of something we simply do not believe? Most of us believe that we are able to do things that are not explicitly commanded or patterned in the New Testament, as long as they are helpful. We just don&rsquo;t agree with YOUR practices recently.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Another statement you make is, &#39;This clash of Biblical interpretation and application ignited the events of 2002-2003. Concepts such as World Sector Leaders, Geographic Sector Leaders, Lead Evangelists, discipling, Bible Talks, central leadership and a &ldquo;leader of the movement&rdquo; were abandoned by most ICOC churches and called &ldquo;unbiblical.&rdquo;&#39;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">You must be joking, Raul! While doctrinal concepts were certainly a part of the discussion, it was not the main problem. What ignited the events of 2003 is that our leader lost the confidence of those he led. The abuse of statistics, the overbearing style of leadership that was harming disciples in many of our churches, and the constant pillaging of US churches to build up the LA church led to many of the problems of 2003. In most people&rsquo;s opinion, leadership needed to be changed. Our leadership structure never matured to meet the demands of a growing, maturing international family of churches. We had submitted ourselves to a Catholic-type system for two decades where all power rested with one man. It became evident that that man needed to sit down for a while and recover himself spiritually. Kip, to his credit, apologized for his sins in various public settings. Change was needed, and it began to happen. Shortly after Kip stepped down, Henry Kriete&rsquo;s letter ignited the anger of many disciples around the world who had been harmed by certain practices within the church. The next two years were quite painful indeed. As I lived through it all, &ldquo;Biblical interpretation&rdquo; was not at the center of the storm. Failed, unbiblical leadership and unresolved conflicts were the cause of the firestorm. It appears that you are trying to rewrite history.&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Please note as well that many of the examples of &ldquo;unbiblical&rdquo; practices you list are still practiced today in the ICOC. I am personally a &ldquo;Lead Evangelist.&rdquo; While no one is using the title of Geographic Sector Leader, we still have many men who carry out similar responsibilities just like Titus did in the New Testament. Obviously, most of our churches have Bible Talks and Discipleship Partners. You need to go back and get your facts straight.&rdquo;</span>

		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Someone is lying. I&rsquo;ve always been taught that the ICOC believes in a different interpretation of Scripture. Yet a &ldquo;Lead Evangelist&rdquo; from the ICOC says differently. It seems to me that we were told that the ICOC believed something different so that all the remnant disciples would stay in our movement and not go to the ICOC. I&rsquo;ve never set foot in the ICOC since becoming a disciple, but I know many in the movement who have. Not one of them has ever come back and said that they believe in a different mode of interpretation of Scripture.</span>

			</span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">Colossians 2:8-10</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">This Scripture says that in Christ, I&rsquo;ve been brought to completeness. It says He is the head over every power and authority. So why do I need a middleman between me and Christ speaking for me where Jesus did not speak? Shouldn&rsquo;t I, through prayer, fasting, Bible study, and advice, come to my own conclusion about how I should live my life? If I don&rsquo;t do that, I may run the danger of someone taking me captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy (like the ICOC&rsquo;s Biblical interpretations), which depends on human traditions such as World Sector Leaders, Overseeing Evangelists, and Discipleship Partners. All these are good and healthy if implemented in the right way, but we do not implement them in a healthy way, and this is why so many are leaving the movement even as I write this letter.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">My second issue with this is that when you build an entire movement based on speaking where the Bible is silent, you end up speaking where the Bible is speaking. For example:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.&rdquo;

		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">According to the Bible, I have the right to decide what I want to give. However, in my nearly 8 years in the movement, not once have I ever been given an option as to how much I could give in regards to Special Missions. I&rsquo;m always told that we are giving a 20x, or a 9x, or a 5x, etc. I&rsquo;m a little confused as to when &ldquo;we&rdquo; decided this. According to the Bible, I get to decide how much I&rsquo;m going to give&mdash;or if I&rsquo;m going to give at all. Again, Kip speaks where the Bible is silent, implements Special Missions, and then says we all need to give and get behind the plan of God. I&rsquo;m sorry, but it seems that the plan of God is directly opposed to the Word of God. Therefore, I must conclude that this is not God&rsquo;s plan and not God&rsquo;s movement. God&rsquo;s leader would not purposely contradict God&rsquo;s Word over and over again, even after many in this movement and prior have warned him about this type of behavior.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;article:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;In our modern world with such busy schedules in such an individualistic and highly structured society, we have found that the only way to guarantee that every member in our congregations is being discipled is to have structured discipling&mdash;discipleship partners.&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">From this, I understand that Kip looked at the structure of today&rsquo;s modern world and concluded that the only way to guarantee every member in our congregation is being discipled is to have structured discipling. So, instead of looking at the Scriptures to understand the culture in God&rsquo;s kingdom and imitating what we see in the Bible, he looked at the world and said, &ldquo;The world is highly structured; therefore, the kingdom needs to be highly structured.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think I need to go into details as to why this is bad theology (but I will later).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">The problem is that it creates an
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">us vs. them</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;mentality with other disciples around the world. We automatically assume that if a group does not have a structured discipling plan, then that group does not believe in discipling. It&rsquo;s a shallow way to judge whether someone is a true disciple. Someone could agree to have a discipler yet not genuinely be a disciple. This approach doesn&rsquo;t address the root of the issue. If someone is not seeking advice, input, direction, correction, teaching, training, and rebuking, perhaps this person does not care about holiness or actually being a Christian.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">If looking at the Bible is not convincing enough, let&rsquo;s just look at the facts: discipleship partners have failed and are failing. Look at the fall-away rate around the movement&mdash;it&rsquo;s close to 80% now. Even in LA, there&rsquo;s a near 90% fall-away rate (369 people were baptized, and 337 people fell away in LA in 2015). So if it clearly is not working and did not work in the prior movement (since, according to Kip, this was one of the first things abandoned when the movement fell apart), then why do we keep doing it? The answer is simple: it is the best way for leadership to spread indoctrination through the fellowship.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">How many times are we told as leaders that we need to discuss the 5 Core Convictions, the Crown of Thorns Project, Special Missions, the GLC, or who we need to delete from social media because they were marked or disfellowshipped, during d-times? Is this really what needs to be addressed in our personal d-times? What about holiness, righteousness, faith, hope, love, and other topics that Christ actually emphasized? We don&rsquo;t do discipleship partners because they work to keep people faithful; they work because they keep people indoctrinated with our unique theology.</span>

		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;Throughout the Bible, the Israelites were at their strongest with the Lord when they had a central leader: Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David. As a matter of fact, the book of Judges says of those days when they did not, &#39;Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.&#39; (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Judges 21:25</span>
			<span class="c1">) In the New Testament, Jesus is the leader of &#39;the Movement!&#39; Uniquely, when He ascends to Heaven, Peter takes on this responsibility as &#39;the apostle to the Jews,&#39; since for the first seven years of Christianity, only Jews became Christians. Interestingly, after Paul became &#39;the apostle to the Gentiles,&#39; the leadership of the movement by
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 15</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;had passed to Jesus&rsquo; oldest half-brother, James. At the Jerusalem Council, James, after listening to both sides of the circumcision issue, gives his singular authoritative &#39;judgment,&#39; which is then bound on all the churches (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 15:19-24</span>
			<span class="c1">). Even Paul, after his missionary journeys, reports to James and submits to his direction (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 21:24</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">The Mainline Church of Christ and the ICOC do not believe in an authoritative central leader or leadership. Sadly, autonomous churches only produce autonomous disciples. In fact, in 2005, some of the most influential ICOC leaders came to me and begged me to be on a &#39;team of leaders&#39; if I would only say that autonomy was &#39;a matter of opinion.&#39; I said, &#39;No. It is sin.&#39; Since I disagreed with them, I was labeled &#39;divisive,&#39; which is what Jesus understood would happen if you preach the truth (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Luke 12:51-53</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">As you said earlier in this article, the Old Testament is richer in examples of centralized leadership with a central leader than the New Testament. That&rsquo;s because the Old Testament deals with the physical nation of Israel. The Israelites weren&rsquo;t just the people of God; they were an independent state. The centralized leadership of the Old Testament was not only to help the Israelites stay close to God but also to enforce the laws of their nation. There are many things that distinguish the Old Covenant from the New Covenant, but I want to focus on one:
			</span>
			<span class="c10 c1">The Holy Spirit.</span>

And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.&rdquo;<br></span>

			<span class="c7 c1 c3">Acts 2:38-39</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Under the Old Covenant, every Israelite did not have access to the Holy Spirit as Christians do today. In most instances, though not all, it was only the leaders and prophets who had personal access to the Holy Spirit. However, God does not deal with His people today in the same way as in the Old Testament. God primarily spoke through the leaders He appointed, but today He speaks to us through Jesus Christ (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Hebrews 1:1-2</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). Today, every Christian has the indwelling of the Holy Spirit upon repentance and baptism.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">If every repented, baptized disciple has the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, why MUST we have a centralized leadership with a central leader to tell us what to do? To tell us where to plant churches? To tell us how much money we are to give for church plantings? Why do we need a leader&rsquo;s permission to make decisions in our lives? It seems as if we are putting a middleman between the people and Jesus, between the people and the Holy Spirit. I&rsquo;m not saying that centralized leadership and a central leader are inherently evil, but our emphasis on centralized leadership and a central leader deemphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in our lives.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Also, contrary to what we teach, after reading through the book of Acts and the entire New Testament, I cannot reach the same conclusion as the movement that James was the leader of the first-century movement. James made one decision that impacted all the churches in the 30-year history of the book of Acts&mdash;does that really make him the sole leader of the movement? I also cannot find any Scripture in the New Testament where anyone proclaims themselves as the leader of the movement, not even Peter or Paul. If no one ever claimed to be the leader of the movement and Jesus left the Holy Spirit to guide us individually as Christians, then why do we have a leader who proclaims himself in this position? In fact, I find more Scripture indicating that no one should ever exalt themselves as the leader of all the churches.</span>

For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&#39;&rdquo;<br></span>

Wouldn&rsquo;t Jesus, if anyone, give very specific instructions on how the church should be structured? He spoke on so many things, yet he leaves out specific instructions on centralized leadership and a central leader.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">In our own article, we say in one part that central leadership is a matter of speaking where the Bible is silent, and then later in the same article, it is claimed that it is sin to be autonomous and not have centralized leadership. Which is it?</span>

			<span class="c1">It&rsquo;s said that &ldquo;Israel was at its strongest with the Lord when they had a central leader: Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David.&rdquo; But if we follow that parallel, it would make Kip the absolute leader of God&rsquo;s people, just like Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and David, with no one able to remove him but God. Therefore, like David, Kip would be our king. The big problem with that is that we already have a King, and His name is Jesus. There is only one other man on earth who has supreme spiritual authority over his people like you do, and that&rsquo;s the Pope&mdash;and even the Pope is elected! This is absurd! Not even Jesus exalted Himself over God&rsquo;s people (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Philippians 2:6-8; Mark 10:45</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Perhaps you could make a case for centralized leadership, but even our modern-day centralized leadership does not operate like the one we see in the book of Acts. The leaders got together once in
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 15</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;to make a decision on doctrinal matters. Our current centralized leadership meets several times a year in an expensive hotel to make decisions about where to plant churches, who to send, and how much money everyone else should raise to support these church plantings&mdash;entirely opinion-based matters, none of which pertain to biblical church issues.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">If the World Sector Leaders and Crown of Thorns Council wanted to be like the centralized leadership in the Bible, they would gather to discuss the erroneous doctrinal issues in the movement, such as &ldquo;speaking where the Bible is silent&rdquo; for a whole group of people, the nature of compulsory giving in contributions and Special Missions, and divorce and remarriage (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). But then again, if they did that, some of our leaders might be disqualified from leadership. So does our current centralized leadership serve itself or serve the people? Do they not trust us enough to pull together and evangelize the world in this generation? Are they so afraid that someone might point out a flaw in you or your system that you&rsquo;ve implemented doctrines and techniques to prevent that from happening?</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The reality is that we do not need centralized leadership to tell us where to plant churches, how much money to raise, and who to send to evangelize the world in this generation. &ldquo;But there has to be leadership, right? Without leadership, how can we be unified?&rdquo; We can certainly be unified in Christ. As we say, &ldquo;If I gave everything up for Jesus and you gave everything up for Jesus, then we have everything in common.&rdquo; See, we can be unified. The only reason we enforce centralized leadership so heavily, though, is because we&rsquo;re trying to make everyone uniform.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">We want every disciple to go through the same studies before and after baptism. We want every church to follow the same methodology of discipleship. We want every disciple to look, act, and speak the same. There can be no divergence here. The centralized leadership we claim is of God is not for the sake of unity but for the sake of uniformity.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">From Mike Taliaferro&rsquo;s article:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;For instance, in defense of his departure, he says that, &#39;I became convinced that the ICOC, for the most part, that I was affiliated with was no longer a movement, whose dream was to evangelize the world in our generation.&#39; I&rsquo;d like to state for the record that I do not know a single evangelist or elder in the ICOC who has renounced this dream. In fact, we are still taking up millions of dollars for mission work around the world. We are still actively building up our churches in over 150 countries. Africa, for instance, has a 30-year plan that begins with the cities and ends with the villages. ICOC churches have planted nearly 100 churches in the last four years. Yes, we hit a very difficult patch in 2003. It was very challenging. But most of us did not cut and run during the driest time in our history. While some ran off and started &ldquo;new movements&rdquo; simply so that they could be in charge once again, most of us stayed with the churches that we began and did not desert &ldquo;the army of God&rdquo; that was still fighting in the field. We are still giving our lives to evangelize the world, and we want to do it in our generation. If it takes longer, so be it. The Holy Spirit is in charge. But we all want to see it happen in our generation.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">Of course, this begs a question. Since the Portland Movement so often talks about winning the world in one generation, well, hasn&rsquo;t Kip had one generation already to do it? Didn&rsquo;t he start trying in 1979 in Boston? It seems to me that after 30 years, he is back to square one. Since you guys are so set on world evangelization taking only one generation, then why is it taking Kip so long? It appears that Kip will need to try a second time to accomplish his goal, and it will take Kip himself at least two generations to do the job. So, why are you so critical of us? We in the ICOC have no idea how long it will take to evangelize the world, but we are committed to doing it in our generation. Please understand that the dream is very much alive in the ICOC. In fact, we are the ones who stood faithful during the tough times in order to see that dream come true.&rdquo;</span>

			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Also, by stressing a deadline for the Great Commission, it gives us a timeless excuse to hold as many Special Missions Contributions as Kip sees fit. Regarding Special Missions, most of the money doesn&rsquo;t even go to the missionaries. I&rsquo;ve sent several missionaries out from Eugene, and in each case, they were responsible for making their 20x Special Missions Contribution plus coming up with an extra $1,000 to support themselves once they arrived on the mission field. Now, if we back home are raising money to support our missionaries, why are they raising money for themselves? And that begs the question: where do these millions of dollars actually go?</span>

		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Secondly, let&rsquo;s be clear about what this &ldquo;Core Conviction&rdquo; really means. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the goal is to evangelize the world in this generation; it means
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">we</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;want to evangelize the world in this generation. Don&rsquo;t be confused&mdash;this isn&rsquo;t about fulfilling Jesus&rsquo; dream; it&rsquo;s about fulfilling Kip&rsquo;s dream to be the hero. If this were about Jesus&rsquo; dream, we would gladly do whatever it took to work with other disciples outside the movement to see the world won. But that&rsquo;s not what we do. In Kip&rsquo;s own words, he believes there are thousands of faithful disciples still in the ICOC. Why do we never hear about them in the Good News email? Because Kip has to be in charge. ICOC and other disciples have offered to work with Kip time and time again, but he always backs out because he must be in charge.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">We could care less what other disciples around the world are doing. If they are not with us in the movement, then they&rsquo;re just not getting the job done, right? Wrong! This &ldquo;Core Conviction&rdquo; creates a sense of self-righteousness in every disciple in the movement. We say that this is what makes a difference. We boast about worldly things like our plan for world evangelism. &ldquo;We have a plan for World Evangelism,&rdquo; we say. &ldquo;Look at OUR Crown of Thorns Project and look at how much WE accomplished in such a short time!&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.&rdquo;<br></span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">James 4:16</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,&rdquo;<br></span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">1 Corinthians 3:21</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">As disciples in the movement, we boast more about our leaders than anyone else. Just because we try to add &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;To God be the glory&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re actually giving God glory.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Do not be deceived. Just look at the stats. In 2012, the movement boasted 40 churches:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;Globally, in five years, the SoldOut Movement is not merely adding but multiplying daily, as the Lord has established through plantings and the gathering of remnant groups of some 40 churches in 19 nations! Excitingly, this summer new SoldOut Discipling Movement churches will be planted in Boston, Mexico City, Orlando, Paris, and San Francisco!&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Now look at where we are in 2016:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;We now mark the beginning of God&rsquo;s new movement with the planting of the City of Angels Church in May 2007 by the 42 sold-out disciples from Portland. Therefore, in the SoldOut Movement&rsquo;s short eight-year history, God has spread His new movement to build 61 churches with 4,000 disciples, with almost 6,000 in attendance on Sundays in 31 nations on all six populated continents of the world!&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">From year 1 to year 5, we went from &ldquo;1&rdquo; church to 40 churches, and then from year 5 to year 8, we went from 40 churches to 61 churches. It appears the movement is slowing down. That&rsquo;s the problem with inflating your stats to make a big deal about what you are doing&mdash;you have to keep inflating them, or someone will come along, analyze the numbers, and find the truth. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem odd that we have more churches in the movement today than seven years ago, but we give more money for special missions now than we did seven years ago? The numbers are telling us that we are not evangelizing the nations in this generation. In fact, the numbers suggest that the ICOC is doing a better job of evangelizing the nations in this generation.</span>

		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">The Bottom Line About the &ldquo;Five Core Convictions&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Early on in the new movement, there were no Five Core Convictions. These were implemented when people who joined the new movement from the ICOC started going back to the ICOC. Once the ICOC recovered from the damage Kip caused, they began to grow and thrive again, making it harder to tell the difference between the two movements. Kip needed to stop the bleeding, so he began to stress differences, however small they were (or, as the research shows, don&rsquo;t even exist).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">The Five Core Convictions are not necessarily wrong, but they aren&rsquo;t necessary. The fact is, the ICC does not preach a gospel-centered message. We preach the gospel
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">plus</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;the Five Core Convictions. The gospel
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">plus</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;First Principles. The gospel
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">plus</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;[insert any doctrine that makes the ICC different from other churches]. When did the gospel stop being enough to take to the lost world? Here&rsquo;s how we know the Five Core Convictions aren&rsquo;t necessary: read through the book of Acts and find the top five themes in the book. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d all come up with five different things, but none of us (except Kip) would come up with the Five Core Convictions. That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not necessary for salvation or for evangelizing the world.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The Five Core Convictions serve one purpose: to make our church seem better than every other church, to keep as many people in the movement as possible.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">The Hyper-Catholic Structure of the Movement that Makes Sinful Leadership Normal</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The second major foundational error I see is our movement&rsquo;s definition of Centralized Leadership. In our movement, the Central Leadership&mdash;comprising the World Sector Leaders and the Crown of Thorns Council&mdash;makes all decisions for the movement. No church is planted without their knowledge. No money is raised for missions without their approval. All major decisions funnel back to Central Leadership and mainly to Kip McKean. To be clear, this is my belief: I believe in Central Leadership. It can be useful, but currently, our model of Central Leadership does not reflect the first-century church, nor does it accurately represent Old Testament theology. Unfortunately, our Central Leadership structure more closely resembles the Catholic Church. (I say &ldquo;resembles&rdquo; because I don&rsquo;t believe we are modeled exactly like the Catholic Church&mdash;yet.)</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">The reasoning for our movement&rsquo;s structure of Centralized Leadership comes mostly from Old Testament examples. Moses was God&rsquo;s appointed leader for the Israelites during the Exodus. When Moses was about to die, he asked God to appoint a leader so the people would not be like sheep without a shepherd (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Numbers 27:15-17</span>
			<span class="c1">). Joshua was selected and led God&rsquo;s people to conquer the Promised Land. After Joshua died, the Israelites experienced dark times during the period of the judges. The best way to sum up the book of Judges is its final verse: &ldquo;In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit&rdquo; (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Judges 21:25</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). Saul was later selected as king, and after him, Israel saw its most prosperous period under King David. King Solomon also led the kingdom through prosperous times, but after him, the nation split into two kingdoms, ultimately leading to captivity.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">We have been taught that we are &ldquo;a Bible church, not just a New Testament church.&rdquo; Therefore, while we are no longer bound by &ldquo;the Law,&rdquo; we can still look to the Old Testament for biblical principles to live by. I agree with this. However, the problem arises when we begin to structure the movement as if it were the nation of Israel in the Old Testament. The church and the nation of Israel are not the same thing. We are already on a slippery slope, which will lead to legalism and placing man before Jesus. When we structure our movement by viewing the church as the Old Testament nation of Israel, Kip McKean, in effect, becomes our king. The obvious problem here is that Jesus is our king, not Kip.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">You might say this is outrageous and deny that Kip is our king. I have said that and preached that as well. But let&rsquo;s examine a few questions. Have you ever intentionally baptized someone who doesn&rsquo;t believe everything outlined in the First Principles Bible studies written by Kip? &ldquo;Well, of course not! That would be dissentious.&rdquo; Would it? Who would you be dissenting against&mdash;Jesus or Kip&rsquo;s theology? Is it truly necessary to believe in world evangelism in a generation to receive salvation? If so, then Kip himself would need to be re-baptized, as he has said that they weren&rsquo;t even thinking about world evangelism in a generation until a few years after Boston in the 80s&mdash;10 years after he was baptized. Does &ldquo;counting the cost&rdquo; to make sure someone believes in world evangelism help them stay faithful to Jesus or to the movement?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">What do you think about someone who says they are not giving the full 20x for Special Missions? Do they feel like they are in sin? Why? Because they&rsquo;re &ldquo;greedy&rdquo;? Are you greedy if you can&rsquo;t afford to give two weeks of your salary just to be a part of the church? Can a church leader intentionally go against central leadership directives and still lead a church in our movement? (The answer is no.) Why not? Why can&rsquo;t I make an informal decision that sending 25x to LA for Special Missions isn&rsquo;t right, especially when we here in Eugene can&rsquo;t afford a place to meet for worship?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Why do we use Scriptures like
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Deuteronomy 17:12-13</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&mdash;&ldquo;Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the Lord your God is to be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel. All the people will hear and be afraid and will not be contemptuous again&rdquo;&mdash;to disfellowship people from the church? To bring this Scripture into the New Testament church, which is poor exegesis, is to intentionally &ldquo;kill&rdquo; them spiritually so that the rest of the church will be afraid and never disagree with leadership again (i.e., to withhold salvation from them). This brings up a whole host of issues, such as whether the church can even withhold salvation if we believe God, not the church, is the one who saves.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">So again, I point out that poor exegesis of the Old Testament makes Kip our king, not Jesus. The church is not the nation of Israel; we are spiritual Israel. Our spiritual king (and actual king) is Jesus. We don&rsquo;t need a human king anymore. But in our current model, Kip&mdash;and his teachings&mdash;act as our king, whether we realize it or not.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Theological Issues with Kip as &ldquo;King&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Another problem with Kip acting as our king is that it raises a deep theological issue. Moses was the leader of all God&rsquo;s people. David was the leader of all God&rsquo;s people. Are we saying that Kip is supposed to be the leader of all Christians everywhere? If so, then we are essentially saying that everyone outside our movement is not saved, since in the Old Testament, God&rsquo;s people were commanded to live as one nation together. We can&rsquo;t claim he&rsquo;s the leader of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s movement&rdquo; without implying he&rsquo;s the leader for all God&rsquo;s people. And if we believe he&rsquo;s the leader of all God&rsquo;s people, then we must acknowledge and act as though there are other Christians outside &ldquo;God&rsquo;s movement.&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">If you think we already do that, try telling your church leader you&rsquo;re going to worship with the ICOC for the next month just because you want to, and see his response. We publicly acknowledge Christians in other fellowships, but when was the last time we actually cooperated with anyone outside the movement? We don&rsquo;t, because we don&rsquo;t really think others are as spiritual as we are.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">One reason why our central leadership is structured like the Catholic Church is because they don&rsquo;t just make decisions for us&mdash;they also define terms for us. Take, for example,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">world evangelism</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;and
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">autonomy.</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;Our movement&rsquo;s tagline is &ldquo;the Evangelization of the Nations in this Generation.&rdquo; But let&rsquo;s be clear: we don&rsquo;t just want
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">world evangelism</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;in this generation; we want
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">to be the ones who evangelize the world.</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not important to us that the world is evangelized in this generation; it&rsquo;s important to us that
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">we</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;are the ones who do it.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">How do we know this? We acknowledge baptisms in the ICOC (as long as they eventually join us), but we don&rsquo;t acknowledge ICOC church plantings. Why not? It&rsquo;s not because we doubt they&rsquo;re making disciples. It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not our central leadership&rsquo;s joy that the world is evangelized; it&rsquo;s their joy that
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">we</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;are the ones evangelizing. We are ambitious to see the world won&mdash;as long as we&rsquo;re the ones doing the winning. We assume that if we aren&rsquo;t doing it, then it&rsquo;s not being done, which is one reason for the ever-increasing Special Missions contributions each year.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Autonomy: Sin or Self-Governance?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">According to our beliefs, autonomy is sin. But this interpretation is based more on ministry experience than actual Bible teaching. In the 70s, Kip was part of an American movement within the Churches of Christ called Campus Advance. When Kip and his contemporaries were campus ministers, they would get hired by Churches of Christ and build dynamic campus ministries. These churches often had fired-up campus ministries alongside, at best, lukewarm older ministries.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Kip learned from Chuck Lucas, who led this movement, to practice &ldquo;counting the cost&rdquo; before baptism, accountability through prayer partners (now known as discipling partners), and other ministry tools. When Kip was hired at the Lexington Church of Christ in 1979, he called the entire congregation to be totally committed (what we now call &ldquo;Sold Out&rdquo;). Incredible growth occurred in Boston, leading Boston to plant other churches with the same model of building churches with only totally committed disciples. This became known as the Boston Movement and later the ICOC (International Church of Christ).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Many look back at the ICOC and think that it grew from 1 church to over 400 in under 25 years solely by building churches of &ldquo;sold-out&rdquo; disciples. But two major events, which Kip often downplays, contributed to this growth. First, in the mid-80s, Chuck Lucas stepped down due to sin, leaving nearly 3,000 trained disciples who joined the ICOC. Secondly, many ICOC churches were
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">reconstructed</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;rather than planted. This meant that an existing church wanting to join the ICOC would receive a trained minister from Boston, while its current leader would go to Boston for training. This approach contrasted with the Churches of Christ, which were closing many doors due to lack of growth. Kip attributed this growth to the influence of an &ldquo;overseeing evangelist,&rdquo; marking the point when autonomy became &ldquo;sin.&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Autonomy wasn&rsquo;t considered sinful when Kip first got baptized, as it was all he knew. Our central leadership defines autonomy as
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">self-governing,</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;which is accurate. The problem arises when we equate autonomy with selfishness, claiming leaders want to be autonomous to avoid supporting world missions and run their own kingdoms. But being self-governing doesn&rsquo;t make someone selfish. In a sense, some autonomy is necessary&mdash;if we are always dependent on others, we risk becoming a burden to the body. Yet, our central leadership tells us that autonomy is sin and that we cannot be a movement if we are autonomous. The Scriptures&mdash;and history&mdash;suggest otherwise.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Local Autonomy in the First Century Church</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">In the first-century church, there was local autonomy, yet all the churches still worked together. For instance, Jerusalem had no part in Paul and Barnabas being sent out on a missionary journey from Antioch. Paul didn&rsquo;t go to Iconium, Lystra, Cyprus, and Derbe under the direction of the apostles in Jerusalem. In fact, the first time Jerusalem even learned about the churches in these plantings was at the council in
			</span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">Acts 15:4.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">The &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; of Our Movement vs. the Jerusalem in Acts</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">At this point, I want to highlight a significant difference: the &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; of our movement and the Jerusalem in the book of Acts. In our movement, LA is considered our &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; based on
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 1:8</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">. LA has the most members, the biggest staff, and the largest contribution. Eventually, many of our most talented young and veteran disciples are sent to LA to be trained because &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; is meant to be a model for the other churches. Additionally, in our movement, our &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; makes all the decisions for the rest of the churches.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">This is far from the Jerusalem of Scripture. The Jerusalem in the Bible was a poor church&mdash;not the one with the biggest payroll. Jerusalem was so poor that the disciples weren&rsquo;t even eating, let alone having enough money to pay all its leaders (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 6:1</span>
			<span class="c1">). Furthermore, the apostles didn&rsquo;t make all the decisions for Jerusalem. When the Hellenistic Jews were overlooked in the distribution of food, the apostles didn&rsquo;t choose the seven men to handle it; the disciples themselves chose the seven and presented them to the apostles (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 6:1-6</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">While this may seem minor, when the Scriptures are retold inaccurately, our modern-day apostles (Central Leadership) retain all the power within their hands. The Jerusalem church didn&rsquo;t oversee the planting of every church in the book of Acts like our modern-day &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; does. If you read the Scriptures closely, you&rsquo;ll find that, many times, the apostles didn&rsquo;t even know a church had started. Look at Philip in Samaria (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 8:14</span>
			<span class="c1">), Barnabas explaining to the apostles about Paul&rsquo;s work in Damascus (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 9:26-28</span>
			<span class="c1">), and Paul explaining to the apostles about the churches planted among the Gentiles (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 15:4</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). Often, the apostles had no idea these things were happening.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">We&rsquo;re often told that Jerusalem was the &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the movement because of the council in
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 15.</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;But the reason the council took place in Jerusalem was because the false doctrine had originated there (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 15:1</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). This wasn&rsquo;t a gathering of every church leader in the movement; it was a council of the apostles and elders from Jerusalem and Antioch, and that&rsquo;s it. The letter was sent to the other churches due to Antioch&rsquo;s influence on those churches, not Jerusalem&rsquo;s. Paul took the letter back to the churches he planted&mdash;churches that Jerusalem did not plant.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">If we were truly &ldquo;Living in the Book of Acts,&rdquo; we wouldn&rsquo;t be under the constant direction of our modern-day &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; But I digress&hellip;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Local Autonomy and the Diversity of the Disciples</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Another example of local autonomy is the diversity of teachings among the disciples. In Jerusalem, disciples were taught to keep the law as Christians, while Paul taught people that they didn&rsquo;t need to keep the law (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 21:20-22</span>
			<span class="c1">). We&rsquo;ve incorrectly taught that all disciples were taught the same thing everywhere, in every church (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">1 Corinthians 4:17</span>
			<span class="c1">). But the Scriptures indicate that Paul taught the same thing everywhere he went&mdash;not that every preacher taught the same thing everywhere. For example, there were disciples of John who preached about the Messiah but knew nothing about the Holy Spirit (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 19:1-5</span>
			<span class="c1">), and there were preachers who spoke about Jesus but didn&rsquo;t know Paul&rsquo;s teachings (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 18:24-28</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">It&rsquo;s clear that the Holy Spirit&mdash;not the apostles in Jerusalem&mdash;sent Philip to preach in Azotus (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 8:39-40</span>
			<span class="c1">). Peter was directed by the Holy Spirit to go to Joppa and convert the first Gentile (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 10:9-48</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). These are examples of people preaching without direction from a central leadership. We would call this autonomy, and it&rsquo;s certainly not sinful. This is simply preaching the word. Just because an overseeing evangelist doesn&rsquo;t instruct you to do something doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re selfish or trying to build your own kingdom.</span>

		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">How Movements Succeed Without Centralized Leadership</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">But how can we expect to succeed as a movement without Centralized Leadership? The same way every other movement has survived from the beginning of time: through respect and cooperation. The First Century church did not have a Central Leader (though some in our Central Leadership argue James was a leader, he wasn&rsquo;t making decisions for every church globally because he didn&rsquo;t know about every church globally).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The Civil Rights Movement did not have Centralized Leadership with a single leader making decisions for every minority across America. Nor did the Women&rsquo;s Suffrage Movement, the Reformation Movement, or the American Revolution. These movements had key contributors but no defined leader who made decisions for every member of their movement.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">This is why our movement resembles the Catholic Church. In Catholicism, the Pope makes all decisions for the Church. He defines doctrine and interprets Scripture, with his Central Leadership responsible for advising him and executing his decisions&mdash;all with the goal of keeping Catholics, Catholic. Similarly, all decisions our Central Leader makes are intended to keep members of the movement in the movement. Sadly, though, our movement has become a church that turned into a business&mdash;and is now just a business trying to retain the properties of a church.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">A Call for Cooperation and Freedom in Central Leadership</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Let me reiterate: I do believe in Centralized Leadership and even appreciate the idea of a Central Leader, but I do not want to be Catholic. Why can&rsquo;t we have freedom in our movement to do what we believe, as disciples and leaders, is best for our cities? Do we not all have the Holy Spirit? Sadly, this freedom isn&rsquo;t our reality.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The event that sparked this journey for me happened when a decision was made for one of our sisters to move to LA to be our World Sector Leader&rsquo;s nanny before we or she were even consulted. My overseeing evangelist accidentally revealed this decision because he assumed I was calling about this very issue that evening. This sister was currently leading a house church in Corvallis and was set to move closer to Eugene by the end of the year to help my wife and me at the University of Oregon. My wife had just given birth to our second daughter in October and needed help managing the ministry while caring for our two daughters under two years of age. Suddenly, we were expected to send this sister to LA immediately.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">When we were first approached about it, I asked if she could move in February or March after my wife had fully recovered from childbirth. This request was met with objection, and I was told it would be best for the sister to move sooner. Our World Sector Leader even stated, &ldquo;This is the best sister we have in all our churches.&rdquo; My wife, already feeling stretched thin from managing two young children, graduate studies at ICCM, and discipling nine women in the church, was upset. This sister was intended to help offload some of this work.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">When I called our World Sector Leader a second time to request a February or March move, I received a 30-minute lecture on how I &ldquo;don&rsquo;t enjoy making leaders,&rdquo; and that if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t need this sister because I&rsquo;d &ldquo;just make more.&rdquo; Ironically, in one phone conversation, we had helped this sister become &ldquo;the best sister we have in all the churches,&rdquo; only to be told in the next that we supposedly didn&rsquo;t enjoy making leaders. Reluctantly, I gave in, not wanting to continue arguing, and we got our hearts behind the plan. We assumed she would move at the end of December. But during our pre-service huddle on November 29th, I learned that she would be leaving by December 10th to arrive in LA by the 13th for their Christmas Service. This sudden change was never communicated to us, leaving us scrambling to find someone to replace her in her apartment so that the sisters could cover rent for December and January.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">This isn&rsquo;t right. Shouldn&rsquo;t we have collaborated to find a solution beneficial for all involved? Why do the sisters in Eugene need to scramble to donate plasma for rent because their roommate was suddenly asked to move to LA to be a nanny for a World Sector Leader with two children, ages 7 and 3? Shouldn&rsquo;t the woman with two daughters under two years old receive childcare help first? Does LA&rsquo;s 900-person congregation truly not have anyone else who can fulfill this role? But under our current model of Central Leadership, it&rsquo;s expected that I get on board with Central Leadership&rsquo;s decisions, as if they are kings whose decrees cannot be overruled.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Let&rsquo;s cooperate together. Let&rsquo;s allow evangelists and local leadership to have a say in major decisions that impact their congregation. Unlike the Catholic Church, we don&rsquo;t have a 1,700-year cultural history to keep people committed despite occasional issues. We have a 35-year history full of division and drama. We need to reform our ways if this is to sustain itself. Kip, as &ldquo;king,&rdquo; is already on his second generation of attempting to evangelize the world &ldquo;in a generation.&rdquo; I want to work with my Central Leadership, not for them. I want to be part of the Movement, not a pawn on Central Leadership&rsquo;s chessboard.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">The Consequences of Our Hyper-Catholic Leadership Structure</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">This Hyper-Catholic Leadership structure makes sinful leadership so normalized that we start to see evil as good and good as evil (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Isaiah 5:20</span>
			<span class="c1">). When I raised this situation with my own disciple, his response was that it happens to him too, and &quot;that&rsquo;s just the way it has to be.&quot; No, it does not have to be this way. We could actually strive to live as Christians and use the whole Bible in our relationships, not just
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Hebrews 13:17.</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;If others wish to continue subjecting themselves to this structure, that is their choice. But I care about a life beyond this world and will put my trust in Jesus&rsquo; words, not in man&rsquo;s interpretations of them.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">The fact is, the way our movement is structured is precisely how Jesus said
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">not</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;to operate the church. Take
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Matthew 23:5-12,</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;where Jesus warns his disciples not to be like the Pharisees:</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called &lsquo;Rabbi&rsquo; by others.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;But you are not to be called &lsquo;Rabbi,&rsquo; for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth &lsquo;father,&rsquo; for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Jesus tells the disciples plainly not to be like the Pharisees. Everything the Pharisees did was for people to see (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Good News Email, CAICC bulletin, Livestream GLC events, etc.</span>
			<span class="c1">).
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Matthew 23:5-6</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;even sounds like a GLC event, with many ICCM students setting their &quot;impossible prayers&quot; on being appointed as Evangelists or Women&rsquo;s Ministry Leaders by the GLC. But this isn&rsquo;t even the root of the issue.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">In
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">verses 8-10,</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;Jesus instructs his apostles not to be called Rabbi, father, or instructor. We know he isn&rsquo;t speaking literally, as Paul refers to himself as a &quot;father in the faith&quot; (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">1 Corinthians 4:15</span>
			<span class="c1">). Jesus is explaining that they don&rsquo;t need an additional authoritative Teacher, as Jesus himself is their Teacher.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Matthew 28:18</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;confirms that
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">all authority</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;has been given to Jesus. Therefore, the apostles couldn&rsquo;t exert absolute spiritual authority over one another&mdash;they were brothers. None of them had authority over the rest. Peter couldn&rsquo;t tell John what he had to do; Thaddeus didn&rsquo;t need to seek advice from Matthew.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Jesus commands them not to have hierarchical relationships where one person holds authority &ldquo;over another in the Lord.&rdquo; He warns them that anyone who exalts themselves over others will be humbled. Yet, in our movement, every point in every lesson focuses on getting into positions of authority and leadership. We live our daily lives in direct opposition to Scripture.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Why We Left: Seeing the Pharisee Within</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">We left because we saw that we were becoming Pharisees ourselves. The same things Jesus said about the Pharisees in
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Matthew 15:6-9</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;can be said about our movement:</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c5 c1">&ldquo;Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: &ldquo;&lsquo;These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Our traditions about the Bible have become as important as the Bible itself. This is the danger of Centralized Leadership: people no longer know where the Scripture ends and leadership&rsquo;s opinions begin. The tradition of discipleship partners has become synonymous with discipling itself, so much so that if discipleship partners were removed in the ICC today, no one would know how to practice discipling. The tradition of Special Missions has been linked to sacrificial giving, to the point that most disciples don&rsquo;t realize that the majority of giving in the Bible was directed to the poor. The tradition of Central Leadership is equated with unity, yet no one sees how disunified the Central Leadership group actually is.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Our central leadership goes directly against Jesus&rsquo; teachings. We place one person over another in a hierarchy of power.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Ecclesiastes 5:8</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;says, &ldquo;If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still.&rdquo; The leadership structure cannot be righteous because it does not have a righteous foundation. Our model is structured exactly like a corporation, complete with a CEO.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Now compare our leadership with Jesus&rsquo; example. When people left Jesus&rsquo; ministry, he let them go:</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c8">
			<span class="c1">&ldquo;From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. &lsquo;You do not want to leave too, do you?&rsquo; Jesus asked the Twelve.&rdquo; &mdash;</span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">John 6:66-67</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">When people left Jesus, he let them walk away. But when someone leaves our movement, we react differently. First, there&rsquo;s a desperate attempt to appeal to their sentiments&mdash;&quot;We&rsquo;re family. We just love and care about you.&rdquo; If that doesn&rsquo;t work, we search for any sin or character flaw to discredit them. And if that fails, we turn to disfellowship and marking.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Other evangelists have seen this and know it&rsquo;s true. This is how Kip operates, and it&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;s operated since the &rsquo;80s. At what point will Central Leadership ask themselves,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;Maybe people become divisive because of our leadership style? Maybe a tree is recognized by its fruit, as Jesus said? Maybe we need to mark or disfellowship people so often because there&rsquo;s a foundational issue?&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;They won&rsquo;t reach this conclusion because it would mean admitting that the foundation was flawed from the start.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Why would I, an evangelist, suddenly leave the ministry? Why would I choose joblessness over ministry? Why would I rather face poverty than remain in a comfortable ministry role? LA was ready to do anything to keep us&mdash;they offered full-time support, allowed me to commute to Oregon to finish my degree, and offered my wife proximity to her parents for childcare help. Why would we refuse all that?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Because I supposedly &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have deep convictions,&rdquo; and because leadership has now informed the disciples here in Eugene that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;not a disciple.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange that leadership reveals someone&rsquo;s sins only after they leave the movement. If these issues were so significant, why weren&rsquo;t they addressed while I was in the movement? The very sin that my discipler told me to keep quiet about in the church is now being used to discredit me in Eugene. Manipulation at its finest.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Do Not Be Deceived, Disciples of the SoldOut Discipling Movement</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Your Central Leadership does not serve you&mdash;you serve them. That&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s designed, like a corporation. They even teach this openly:
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Disciple = Christian = Saved = Worker.</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;When you got baptized, you became an employee of the church. This is why you tag every weekend, attend so many meetings, and give so much of your money. Just like a corporation owns its employees, the movement owns its disciples. You will never make another decision in your life without getting advice or permission.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The issue isn&rsquo;t even the people; it&rsquo;s the system itself. The structure is deeply flawed and can only operate like this for so long before people start to catch on and walk away.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">The Bottom Line About the Leadership Structure of the Movement</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The ICC has transitioned from a church to a business, and is now simply a business trying to retain the properties of a church. The movement is structured like a corporation, with disciples as employees. This corporate-like structure unfortunately brings along corporate-like sins: greed, self-ambition, slander, gossip, manipulation, deceit, dishonesty, pride, and dissension.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Eventually, everyone leaves this structure. The problem with structuring the church like the world is that you cannot mix the two.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;(</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">2 Corinthians 6:14</span>
			<span class="c1">). The main advantage of the corporate model is that it&rsquo;s easily replicable&mdash;you can spread it across the world. Make a disciple of the corporation who makes another disciple, and so forth. But it&rsquo;s worldly, and it will never sustain itself in God&rsquo;s Kingdom.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">&ldquo;Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?&rdquo;</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;(</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">1 Corinthians 1:20</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). When Christianity is incorporated, people become loyal to the Corporation, not to Jesus Christ.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">A Movement Built on Money</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">I want to start with a clear statement so there&rsquo;s no confusion about what I believe: I believe in Special Missions, and I believe we should take up a Special Missions contribution each year. If you&rsquo;re looking for support against Special Missions, this isn&rsquo;t the article for you. That said, my issue lies in
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">how</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;we give Special Missions, not in the giving itself. Under our current model, we don&rsquo;t
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">give</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;Special Missions; we
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">pay</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;Special Missions.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">How Special Missions Contributions Really Work</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Currently, this is how Special Missions operates: The Crown of Thorns Council&mdash;which includes our World Sector Leaders, movement Shepherds, administrators, and a select group of Evangelists and Women&rsquo;s Ministry Leaders&mdash;gathers to assess the state of our movement and make plans for its future. Based on their judgment, they determine the multiplier for Special Missions and how many times we&rsquo;ll hold Special Missions in a year. As a church leader, I have no say in this decision; I usually find out only days before it&rsquo;s publicly announced. In the 18 months I&rsquo;ve led a church, we&rsquo;ve had three Special Missions, with another three scheduled for 2016.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The amount each church is expected to contribute in the Spring is typically a multiple of the previous October&rsquo;s weekly contribution average. Fall Missions are based on the June contribution average, which is why pledge drives are often scheduled in January and after the GLC&mdash;to ensure we &ldquo;blow out&rdquo; our Special Missions goal based on new pledges. As a church leader, my only flexibility is in correcting any misreported averages during these periods, as we&rsquo;re required to send monthly reports to LA. However, I have no say in the total multiple we raise or send; we are expected to send everything except a 1x to cover our weekly needs. This model presents a significant Biblical issue.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">The Biblical Issue with Our Special Missions Model</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The issue is threefold:</span>
		</p>
		<ol class="c12 lst-kix_makyz4uc5zic-0 start" start="1">
			<li class="c0 c6 li-bullet-0">
				<span class="c1 c11">The first-century church didn&rsquo;t operate this way.</span>
				<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;Special Missions as we know it doesn&rsquo;t exist in the Bible, and while we may reference Old Testament examples (e.g., collecting funds for the temple or tabernacle), these were one-time collections, not annual ones. Pointing to David&rsquo;s example or similar stories for annual fundraising doesn&rsquo;t align with New Testament practices.</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c0 c6 li-bullet-0">
				<span class="c1 c11">Claiming we are imitating the first-century church is misleading.</span>
				<span class="c1">&nbsp;If we were following their model, we wouldn&rsquo;t command disciples on what to give each year. When David collected funds for the temple, the people gave willingly without being told how much they were expected to contribute (</span>
				<span class="c1 c3">2 Chronicles 29:6</span>
				<span class="c5 c1">). In the New Covenant and the book of Acts, we don&rsquo;t see this annual demand for specific amounts.</span>
			</li>
			<li class="c0 c6 li-bullet-0">
				<span class="c1 c11">The current model leads people to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;give&rdquo; to Special Missions.</span>
				<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;No matter how well-intentioned the leaders or disciples may be, the structure promotes giving under compulsion rather than generosity.</span>
			</li>
		</ol><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Where Does the Money Really Go?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The reality is that the Movement has no money. LA operates on a line of credit, so the funds raised through Special Missions often go to paying down that credit, not to actual missions work. In 2015, we raised $2.6 million to plant six churches, yet I know that starting the Sacramento church only cost $23,000. So, where did the other $2,577,000 go? It doesn&rsquo;t take $500,000 to plant a church. We didn&rsquo;t send all that money to other churches around the world; instead, it went toward paying down LA&rsquo;s credit debt. This kind of financial handling reveals a level of deceit within the movement that is truly disheartening.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Why We Had an Impromptu 3x Missions Contribution in February</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">The truth is, LA was about to run completely out of money. The LA administrator met with Kip, explaining that the LA church would be out of funds by January 15th. Fortunately, an anonymous donor made a six-figure contribution in January to keep the church afloat, followed by a &ldquo;generosity drive&rdquo; in January and a 3x Missions Contribution in February. This is why we hold Special Missions contributions: to hit the goal, because the movement&mdash;particularly LA&mdash;is struggling financially.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Misinterpreted Scriptures on Collections and Contributions</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">For anyone familiar with the Bible, several Scriptures likely come to mind regarding taking up collections and sending money back to Jerusalem. These passages are often used to justify our model of Special Missions:
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 4:32-36; Romans 15:25-28; 1 Corinthians 16:1-4; 2 Corinthians 8-9;</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;and
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 11:27-30</span>
			<span class="c1">. On the surface, these seem to support the idea of collecting funds and sending them to LA for our central leadership to distribute. However, the one major flaw in this interpretation is that the money Paul collected was for
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">benevolence</span>
			<span class="c1">, not
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">missions work</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">. In the first century, the apostles never collected funds specifically for planting churches.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Instead, the apostles were focused on meeting the needs of local congregations, especially in the distribution of food (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 6:1-7; 11:27-30</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). Jerusalem went through a famine, leaving many disciples without food. Paul collected funds to support the poor church in Jerusalem&mdash;a church quite different from our modern-day &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; in LA, which has the highest weekly contribution (25x that of Eugene). In all these cited Scriptures, the collection was for benevolent purposes, not church planting. Although we might say that &ldquo;we are materially rich here in America and need to support the spiritually poor worldwide through missions,&rdquo; we cannot use these Scriptures to justify that view.</span>
		</p><hr><p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">The Importance of Differentiating Benevolence from Missions</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">The Scriptures and the practice of the first-century church show that nearly all collected funds were for benevolence, not planting churches. Why is this distinction important? Because if a leader uses these Scriptures to demand a specific multiple of weekly contributions for Missions, they are no longer imitating the New Testament. Paul explicitly states that disciples gave what they decided in their hearts, not what others told them to give (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Acts 11:29; 2 Corinthians 9:7</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">).</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">The reason disciples raised so much for benevolence was that Jesus taught it was a salvation issue to care for the poor and needy, especially among believers (</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">Matthew 25:31-46</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">). When Paul spoke about &ldquo;testing the sincerity of your faith,&rdquo; he referred to willingness to support brothers and sisters in need, not mission contributions. Some might argue that supporting missionaries in challenging countries is a priority, and I agree. But such support would be a benevolent offering, not a mandatory multiple of weekly contributions through Missions. Misunderstanding or misrepresenting this distinction risks misappropriating funds, which is not only unethical but illegal.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Sadly, in this respect, we aren&rsquo;t much different from other churches that allocate only 5-10% of their donations to local benevolence. Within our movement, most churches allocate about 10% to local benevolence.
			</span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">I exclude MERCY Worldwide payments here since local churches are required to give to MERCY Worldwide, meaning it&rsquo;s not strictly benevolent.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Benevolence and Church Planting in the First Century</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Another reason why the disciples could focus on giving benevolence is because, in the first century, they did not need money to plant churches. I know this doesn&rsquo;t seem possible, but if you read the book of Acts, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">So, how were churches planted? Often, it was through persecution. The starting of new churches in other cities came as a result of having to relocate due to persecution.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3 c7">(Acts 8:1; 14:1-6)</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Another way churches were planted in Acts was that those planting churches funded their missions personally. For instance, when Paul arrived in a city, he often worked to support himself.
			</span>
			<span class="c7 c1 c3">(1 Corinthians 18:1-4; 1 Thessalonians 2:9-10)</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Wouldn&rsquo;t this be a cheaper solution than raising millions to plant a few churches a year? In 2015, according to a bulletin published by the City of Angels church, we raised $2.6 million and planted 6 churches. I know for a fact that it doesn&rsquo;t cost $433,000 to start a church. Many churches in the movement, including the Eugene church, won&rsquo;t even take up that much money over the next two years.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Thus, part of that $2.6 million, and apparently a significant portion, went to support churches that had already been planted. This means that even though we contributed significantly in 2014 for missions in places like Sydney, Australia, we continued to fundraise to support them in 2015. In fact, we&rsquo;re supporting churches in North America, South America, Africa, and Europe year after year.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Despite planting more churches, the financial burden on members has increased to support previously funded churches.
			</span>
			<span class="c10 c1">(It may seem confusing, but Central Leadership&#39;s approach each year enables this ongoing financial expectation from members.)</span>

Central Leadership doesn&rsquo;t merely suggest that we contribute 20x in May; they expect it, often spending Missions funds before the full amount is even collected.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Typically, a genuine gift is unexpected and freely given. For instance, in the Book of Acts, people gave based on their ability
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">(Acts 11:29-30)</span>
			<span class="c1">. However, if we are told how much to contribute, it becomes an instruction rather than a gift. With Special Missions, we&rsquo;re informed of the amount and timeline, so it&rsquo;s a compulsion rather than a willing contribution
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">(2 Corinthians 9:7)</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Central Leadership circumvents direct requests by only setting expectations for the entire church to meet specific financial goals. So, while one person may give 3x and another 37x, the overall goal is what matters to leadership. By placing the pressure on churches through inspiring sermons, stories, and impact emails, they avoid &ldquo;technically&rdquo; compelling any individual to give.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Yet, if the Bible prohibits dictating individual giving amounts, how can one church enforce this on another church? My movement-minded leaders might cite Paul&rsquo;s instructions for the churches to support Jerusalem, but this was benevolence, not a set mission goal.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">If we truly aim to model the Book of Acts, Central Leadership should collect offerings responsibly rather than imposing predetermined missions contributions. Forcing Special Missions contributions every three months, as we currently do (9x in November, 3x in February, and 20x in May), is backward.
			</span>
			<span class="c10 c1">As the saying goes, &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t put the cart before the horse.&rdquo;</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Additional Financial Contributions to LA and Their Impact</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that LA doesn&rsquo;t just receive your Special Missions Contribution; they also receive your Central Administration payment and MERCY payment.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">16% of your weekly contribution goes to Central Administration</span>
			<span class="c1">, and
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">3% goes to MERCY Worldwide</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">So, for those disciples outside of LA, your weekly contribution does not solely support the work in your church. You are giving money to support both your church
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">and</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;the LA church.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">It&rsquo;s important to note that
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">90% of money given to MERCY Worldwide does not fund MERCY Projects</span>
			<span class="c1">; instead, it goes towards salaries, including that of a World Sector Leader.
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">(If LA tries to dispute this, I will publish the official IRS report for MERCY from 2014.)</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;So, in reality,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">only 81% of your contribution directly supports your ministry</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">, and that percentage has been shrinking.</span>

			<span class="c10 c1">The Implications of Ongoing Financial Commitments</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">This brings us to a key point: we must plant more churches. And remember, these contributions are
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">payments</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">, not gifts. In Eugene, we reached a point where we could no longer sustain these payments, leading me to write an email to Kip and Michael Kirchner requesting a six-month break from the Central Administration payments. Essentially, I had to ask permission not to send them money.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">From a literal or Biblical standpoint, it raises a question:
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">Why should one church be obligated to fund another church?</span>
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;This year alone, LA will receive over
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">$700,000</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;in Central Administration and MERCY payments.</span>

		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c10 c1">Closing Thoughts and Proposed Solutions for Missions Giving</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">To close out, I want to reiterate my opening statement:
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">I believe in Special Missions, and I believe we should take up a Special Missions contribution every year.</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;If you&#39;re looking for support for why we should not take Special Missions, this is not the article. We absolutely need to support World Missions and be passionate about it. I think it is very beneficial for us &ldquo;rich&rdquo; American disciples to sacrifice for those on the Mission field in less fortunate areas.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">However,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">our current model is totally unbiblical and doesn&rsquo;t appear to be blessed by God</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;if we look beyond the raw data. For example, raising $2.6 million and planting only 6 churches hardly seems like a blessing from God.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Every church in the world believes that every good thing that happens in their church is a blessing from God, but often these religious communities are as misguided as their leaders on doctrines of salvation. We need to test the Spirit and consider our ways if we truly want to evangelize the world in this generation.</span>

			<span class="c10 c14">Solution 1: Allow Local Evangelists More Control Over Special Missions Goals</span>
		</h3>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">One solution is for the
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">Local Evangelist to establish a Special Missions goal for their own church</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;and decide how much stays in the local church versus how much is sent out. Currently, our Evangelists function more like glorified supervisors; unless recognized in the Crown Thorn Council, they have little say in church planting or fundraising goals.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Why not let Evangelists and Shepherds operate in their intended roles, instead of as Fundraising Coordinators? Shouldn&rsquo;t local leaders be able to decide, based on the needs of their church and the movement, what their own Special Missions goal should be?</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">If our Evangelists are not capable of making such a spiritually informed decision, we have a larger issue than simply not raising enough money this year.</span>

			<span class="c10 c14">Solution 2: Invest in Existing Churches Rather Than Constant Expansion</span>
		</h3>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Another solution is to
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">stop having churches that aren&rsquo;t growing plant new churches</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">. According to the City of Angels financial presentation, our fifth fastest-growing church in 2015 was only growing at 41%, with the remaining 56 churches growing at less than 40%, and some even showing negative growth.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Wouldn&rsquo;t it make more sense to invest in growing our existing churches instead of pressuring struggling ones to sacrifice even more? For example, the Eugene church went from 56 disciples to 46 in 2015, even after sending out 8 Bible Talk Leaders to support other churches and beginning the New Year by sending out 3 more leaders.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Why not
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">focus on sustaining what we have before expanding</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">? Currently, we raise money to plant new churches but then have to fund them indefinitely, sending our best leaders to LA for training while our local churches struggle.</span>

			<span class="c10 c14">Solution 3: Prioritize Planting More American Churches</span>
		</h3>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Why not
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">focus on cheaper church plantings within the United States</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">? Planting in American cities would be more affordable and would expand our base of contributors for Special Missions.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">For example, Gainesville was planted for only $15,000, and Sacramento for $23,000. Compare this to the cost of planting in expensive cities like Dubai or in third-world countries, where financial support is required indefinitely. While we are not more important than other nations, maximizing our resources would prevent the exhaustion of funds before they&rsquo;re raised.</span>

			<span class="c10 c14">Solution 4: Live Out the Book of Acts by Minimizing Full-Time Salaries</span>
		</h3>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">A more radical solution, but one I&rsquo;m willing to be the first to try, is to
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">live in the Book of Acts</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;by minimizing full-time salaries for church leaders. In the Book of Acts, most church planting was done without full-time salaries.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">Our movement&rsquo;s push to get as many people as possible into full-time ministry increases costs. I&rsquo;ve already documented instances where Paul preached full-time without pay. While Paul states, &ldquo;Those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel&rdquo;
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">(1 Corinthians 9:14)</span>
			<span class="c1">, he also emphasizes that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be paid if it would hinder the gospel
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c3">(1 Corinthians 9:12)</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1">If we&rsquo;re forcing members to give 28x their weekly contribution, which equates to nearly three weeks&rsquo; salary for a 10% tithe or over a month&rsquo;s salary for those giving 16%,
			</span>
			<span class="c1 c11">we&rsquo;re hindering spiritual growth</span>
			<span class="c5 c1">. Perhaps this is one reason our movement has a 50% fall-away rate.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">Why not plant churches without money, as they did in the Book of Acts? We could work regular jobs, stop renting expensive conference centers, and hold workshops and retreats in homes instead. Expensive conferences can be a burden, especially when disciples back home are struggling to pay rent.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">Brother, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re na&iuml;ve. You&rsquo;ve been doing this for 40 years; I believe you know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing. I, for one, am not going to stand for it. I love you, but you are not being honest with God&rsquo;s people. You have them believing a beautiful lie.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">I pray you don&rsquo;t resort to what you&rsquo;re accustomed to doing. If my hunch is correct, you&rsquo;ll try to bury this by slandering my name and discrediting anything I have to say. I know you&rsquo;re ticked off right now. But more than that, you&rsquo;re scared. That&rsquo;s why you sent four evangelists to Eugene just because one stepped out. You&rsquo;re afraid that what you&rsquo;ve built will be exposed for what it truly is.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c5 c1">I beg you to come into the light. We are actually rooting for you. I would follow you to the day you die if you were a just, honest, and truthful disciple. If you would only cast off competing with the ICOC and the selfish ambition, you wouldn&rsquo;t need two generations to achieve what you said would happen in one. Please, before it&rsquo;s too late&mdash;you know this thing won&rsquo;t last much longer, but you can&rsquo;t let anyone know.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1">You have an opportunity here. You can keep going down this path in the name of &ldquo;Family Till the End,&rdquo; or you can be courageous and call out what you&rsquo;ve been seeing for years.

The sad part is that many of you know it and choose to remain silent for all the obvious reasons. I&rsquo;m not calling for rebellion; I&rsquo;m calling for change or for you to leave.

			<span class="c5 c1">It&rsquo;s happening again. The thing you fear most is happening again. Our movement is crashing. There is no money, and people are leaving faster than they&rsquo;re being baptized. You have influence. Do something. You know you felt it when that 3x contribution was announced.

		</p>
		<p class="c4">
			<span class="c5 c1">leaders. They need your money, your evangelism, your friends, your family, and your time. They only have the authority you give them.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c4">
			<span class="c5 c1">Remember, I am not from the Old Movement. I was trained by the LA church. I was appointed by the LA church. And I was sent out by the LA church. Since I&rsquo;ve left they&rsquo;ve done exactly what I said they would. They&rsquo;ve already begun to soil my name with sin that they helped cover up. They are using manipulation and deceit to win the disciples after themselves. Soon will come a letter about marking and disfellowshipment (again) In reality, that&rsquo;s all they can do. They cannot answer anything I am saying because they know it&#39;s true. All they can say is that I&rsquo;m evil and to control who talks to me on Facebook. They fear the people thinking for themselves. It&rsquo;s too dangerous. They must protect themselves at any cost.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c4">
			<span class="c5 c1">This is what they do. They show up and you show up guarded and with questions. Tell you how awful it was that someone left the church. I&#39;ve been on the phone with TK, &quot;When I disfellowship a guy, I make the church feel like I&#39;m sad. That&#39;s the most important thing bro. The church must believe that you&#39;re actually sad&quot; This is what he said to me when other people left the church in Eugene. They tell you how sad it is that Satan got to that person. Then before you realize it, they&#39;re giving you an inspirational lesson about how we need to save the world. You laugh and get excited and by the end of it you&#39;re more fired up to give them more of your time and money than you ever had. And then you treat the person who left as if they had a disease. A week ago, this person was your best friend in The Kingdom. You were going to leave the Lord and they helped you keep your faith. And now they may or may not be a disciple. Then they go, hang out with you, buy you lunch and you feel so loved. You&#39;re so enamored with their spirituality. This person could never have an evil bone in their body. After all, the other guy left. (By the way, can someone explain the least hurtful way to leave the ICC? There isn&#39;t because it&#39;s the only true church out there right?) And just like that all the questions and suspicions you have are gone. This is how we&#39;re trained in LA.</span>

			<span class="c5 c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c4">
			<span class="c5 c1">But the reality is the ICC will cease to exist in less than 10 years. It&rsquo;s crashing. It has no money and all the older mature disciples are leaving. Leaving only na&iuml;ve, young campus students who they will dangle leadership in front of their faces so long that that&rsquo;s all the young people care about anymore.</span>
